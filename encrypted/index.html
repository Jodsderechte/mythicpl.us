For the visual learners, here's a quick video showing the <strong>Vy Relic</strong> dying first, then the other relics dying, then the <strong>Vy Interceptor</strong> miniboss spawning.</p>

				<h1 class="title title--large trn">The Minibosses</h1>
				<p>Each miniboss has different abilities. Here's a quick breakdown of what each miniboss does:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Killing the <strong>Urh Relic </strong>first will cause the <strong>Urh Deconstructor</strong> to spawn after all the relics are dead. The <strong>Urh Deconstructor</strong> has two abilities:<em>Deconstruct, </em>a medium damage attack which causes the target to take 25% more damage from all sources, and <em>Force Slam</em>, an AOE attack around the miniboss that causes a 1.5 second stun if you get hit by it.</li>
						<br>
						<li>Killing the <strong>Vy Relic </strong>first will cause the <strong>Vy Interceptor </strong>to spawn after all the relics are dead. The <strong>Vy Interceptor </strong> <em>shoots</em> random players in range for low damage, and will periodically cast <em>Fusion Beam</em>, causing the <strong>Vy Interceptor</strong> to teleport away and target a player with a dodgeable line attack. Here's a quick video of it:

						</li>
						<li>Killing the <strong>Wo Relic </strong>first will cause the <strong>Wo Drifter</strong> to spawn after all the relics are dead. The <strong>Wo Drifter</strong> melees the tank for low damage, and periodically casts a spell called <em>Burst</em>, which does high damage after a 3 second cast and <strong>can be interrupted</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
						<p>After the miniboss is defeated, it awards the group a buff!</p>

				<h1 class="title title--large trn">The Buffs</h1>
				<p>When a miniboss is defeated, the group is awarded a buff. Each miniboss awards a different buff. Here's a list of the buffs each miniboss awards:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Defeating the <strong>Urh Dismantler</strong> awards <em>Decrypted Urh Cypher</em>: 200% cooldown reduction on all abilities, and restores 10% HP and 10% mana every second for 10 seconds.</li>
					<li>Defeating the <strong>Vy Interceptor</strong> awards <em>Decrypted Vy Cypher</em>: 15% increased haste, and a chance on hit to do additional damage or chance on heal to do additional healing.</li>
					<li>Defeating the <strong>Wo Drifter</strong> awards <em>Decrypted Wo Cypher</em>: 150% increased movement speed, 15% damage reduction, out of combat stealth.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Here's what it looks like when a miniboss is defeated and you are awarded a buff:</p>

				<h1 class="title title--large trn">Strategy/notes</h1>
				<p>Here are some notes I've jotted down after running a few keys this season:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>I'm sure there will be an established meta in the coming weeks, but for now I see <strong>no reason to ever fight the Wo Drifter miniboss because the buff is pointless</strong>. Anything you would normally skip can still be skipped via potions or other methods and the 200% cooldown reduction or increase haste is better than the move speed.</li>
					<li>Sometimes the relics are scattered enough that they don't all pull at once.</li>
					<li>The <strong>Vy Interceptor</strong> has a bad habit of teleporting into unpulled trash. Be careful of this, especially if you have pet classes in your group.</li>
				</ol>
