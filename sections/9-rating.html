			<div class="text-block">
				<p class="hard">Newly introduced in 9.1, Mythic+ Rating is more less Blizzard's official in-game implementation of raider.io's score system, with a few key differences.</p>
				<p>Your rating increases each time you run a dungeon you haven't completed before, complete a dungeon at a higher keystone level than your previous best, or when you beat your best time in a dungeon you've already completed. Completing a key provides a rating based on three factors:
					<br>
					the level of the key
					<br>
					the Affixes on the key
					<br>
					the amount of time it took you to finish the run
					<br>
					Unlike season one, Valor upgrades are now tied to your character's Mythic+ rating. Like Conquest and other similar systems, your Mythic+ Rating will be reset at the start of a new season.</p>
					<p>In order to maximize your score, you must complete every dungeon on both <span class="hard">Fortified</span> and <span class="hard">Tyrannical</span> weeks, as they are scored separately. Whichever of the two versions yields your higher rating for each dungeon will provide full points, and the other will provide 1/3rd of the points. Check the example below for more information.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="table__note">
					<p>Example: Let's say you've achieved the following ratings in Plaguefall: Fortified - 100, Tyrannical - 90</p>
					<p>Your rating for Plaguefall would then be: (higher rating) + (1/3)*(lower rating) = (100) + (1/3)*(90) = <span class="hard">130</span></p>
					<p>Your overall Mythic+ Rating is simply the sum of your ratings for all dungeons.</p>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>If any player in a dungeon run is able to increase their Mythic+ Rating from the run, all players in the group are granted 65 bonus Valor, for a total of 200 Valor at the end.</p>
