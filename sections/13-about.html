				<p>I wrote and re-wrote this one hundred times and it still comes off a little self-indulgent, but I wanted to write out some of the guiding stuff that led me to creating this site. I'll keep it short.</p><br>
				<p>I wanted to make a site that was fast and clean. No third party trackers or ads. No heavy Javascript, no autoplaying videos. I don't make money from your traffic, and I don't want your data. I was previously using Google Analytics for my own curiosity, but removed it because of all the privacy implications. I'm one dude - I don't pay a staff to maintain this site or anything and I'm not beholden to a parent company or whatever. This isn't a heavy application that processes tons of user requests and requires a lot of servers to run. If you really want to help pay for server time or domain name renewals, I offer a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mythicplus">Patreon</a>.</p>
				<p>I wanted to showcase community made stuff, and curate tools and addons. This mostly started with addons and Weakauras that I used personally, but grew into promoting raider.io early on, as well as community Discord servers.</p>
				<p>I wanted to make a site that allows people to contribute information freely. My interest in World of Warcraft waxes and wanes, but I want to keep the information up-to-date and useful even if I'm not playing the game. I have admittedly been pretty bad at seeking out information to keep everything current. Every commit is on <a href="https://github.com/domainzero/mythicpl.us">Github</a> (for better or for worse - I am an absolute idiot and commit really dumb things), and pull requests are always welcome.</p>
				<p>Thanks again for visiting! Don't be a stranger!</p>
