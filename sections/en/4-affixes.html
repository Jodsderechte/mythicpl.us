						<p>Non-bosses have more health and deal 30% more damage.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: interrupting and dodging any/all enemy abilities becomes an absolute priority with this affix. Most of the time spent in the dungeon will be fighting beefy trash.</p>

						<p>Non-boss enemies buff nearby allies on death, increasing maximum health by 15% and damage by 20%. This effect stacks.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">Note: it's important to kill all the trash in a pull as closely together as possible with this affix as enemies effectively heal as they gain max health.

						<p><span class="med">Raging</span></p>

					<li class="affixes-list__item-4-7 affix-sanguine">
						<p><span class="easy">Sanguine</span></p>

						<p><span class="med">Storming</span></p>
						<p>Tornadoes spawn around enemy creatures while in combat.</p>

						<p><strong>Enemies have 5% more health.</strong> While in combat, players are periodically overcharged with primal power from Raszageth's unending storm. This power comes with great risk, and failure to discharge it quickly can have stunning consequences.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note">More notes on this to come when the final affix is live. Two players get buffs, <strong>Mark of Wind</strong> and <strong>Mark of Lightning</strong>. While the buff is active, those players get a 30% damage and healing increase for 15 seconds. If the two marked players touch, the buffs are dispelled. If the buff is not dispelled by the end of its duration the buff becomes Primal Overload, stunning each player for 5 seconds and inflicting nature damage.</p>
