						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="fortified_note">Note: interrupting and dodging any/all trash mob abilities becomes an absolute priority with this affix. Most of the time spent in the dungeon will be fighting beefy trash, don't be afraid to use CDs.</p>

						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="tyrannical_note">Note: Boss abilities are no longer trivial. Boss mechanics need to be done or people will die. Some fights become endurance tests because they last so long.</p>

						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="bolstering_note">Note: it's important to kill all the trash in a pull as closely together as possible with this affix as mobs effectively heal as they gain max health (percent translation). Adds spawned from a trash mob or boss ability do not trigger bolster. Bolstering falls off after 20 seconds.</p>

						<p class="trn" data-trn-key="bursting_info">Non-boss enemies explode on death, causing all players to suffer flat damage that scales with keystone level. This effect stacks.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="bursting_note">Note: This effect stacks, so it is safest to let the stacks drop before killing multiple enemies. Now dispellable!</p>

						<p><span class="easy trn">Inspiring</span></p>

						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="inspiring_note">Note: The <b>Inspiring Presence</b> buff makes mobs immune to crowd control. The mobs that have this buff appear to be fixed (as in they will always be the same every time), and do not apply this buff to themselves.</p>

						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="raging_note">Note: mobs with high damage targeted abilities or high damage AoE abilities become deadly with this affix. Be sure to focus fire mobs down so there aren't multiple enraged mobs at once. Soothe effects remove the enrage!</p>

						<p><span class="easy trn">Sanguine</span></p>

						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="explosive_note">Note: The explosive orb will spawn and begin casting a six second cast. If the cast goes off, the entire party will take 40% of their max hp in damage. They are <strong>AOE immune so you can't cleave them down!</strong> They can also spawn during boss fights.</p>

						<p><span class="hard trn">Necrotic</span></p>
						<p class="trn" data-trn-key="necrotic_info">Enemy melee attacks apply a stacking debuff that deals damage and reduces healing received. Debuff lasts 5 seconds and is dispelled when exiting combat.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="necrotic_note">Note: Strong AoE CC or slows are great for this affix to allow for kiting mobs while the tank's Necrotic stacks fall off. Bosses only apply necrotic on every other melee hit.",</p>

						<p><span class="med trn">Prideful (Season 1)</span></p>
						<p class="trn" data-trn-key="prideful_info">Killing enemies fills a progress bar. Every 20% on the bar spawns a <i>Manifestation of Pride</i>. Killing the <i>Manifestation of Pride</i> provides players with a buff.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="prideful_note">The buff you get from killing the <i>Manifestation of Pride</i> is pretty good, as it increases Mana Regeneration by 5% per second, damage dealt by 30%, and Movement Speed by 60% for a minute. The <i>Manifestation of Pride</i> has somewhere around 30% of the health of a dungeon boss and does heavy AoE damage every 2 seconds of the fight. You'll probably want to position this enemy to be near a boss or difficult trash pull so you can make the most use of the buff.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-10 affix-tormented">
						<p><span class="med trn">Tormented (Season 2)</span></p>
						<p class="trn" data-trn-key="tormented_info">Servants of the Jailer can be found throughout the dungeon and grant powerful boons when defeated. If a servant is not dealt with, they empower the final boss.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note trn" data-trn-key="tormented_note">Four Lieutenants are available to kill in the dungeon. When you kill a lieutenant, each party member gets an Anima Power. For every lieutenant still up when the final boss is pulled, it will apply an aura that will make the final boss harder.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-10 affix-encrypted">
						<p><span class="med trn">Encrypted (Season 3)</span></p>
						<p class="trn">Enemies throughout the dungeon possess relics of the First Ones. Destroy the relics to summon the First Ones' Automa and gain powerful bonuses, based on the order in which they were destroyed.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note trn">Note: The first relic you destroy in a pack determines the buff you're going to get. A miniboss appears after one of the relics has been destroyed. After the miniboss is defeated, you get a buff from the miniboss you fought. <a href="/encrypted">Lots more info here.</a>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li class="affixes-list__item-10 affix-shrouded">
						<p><span class="med trn">Shrouded (Season 4)</span></p>
						<p class="trn">Some enemies in the dungeon will reveal themselves to be dreadlords. Defeating them grants you a stack of a buff that provides you secondary stats of your choosing and restore health and mana.</p>
						<p class="affixes-list__note trn">Note: A broker appears at the start of the keystone, asking you to choose a bounty. The bounty you choose determines the secondary stat you will receive after defeating a dreadlord. One of the dreadlords will be a miniboss with special abilities. More to come on that after I run some keys.</p>
