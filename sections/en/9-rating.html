			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Mythic+ score is an indicator of a player's mythic+ experience.</p>
				<p>Your rating increases as a result of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>each time you run a dungeon you haven't completed before</li>
						<li>complete a dungeon at a higher keystone level than your previous best</li>
						<li>beat your best time in a dungeon you've already completed.</li>
					</ul>
						Completing a key provides a rating based on three factors:
					<ul>
						<li>the level of the key</li>
						<li>the Affixes on the key</li>
						<li>the amount of time it took to finish the run</li>
					</ul>
					Mythic+ rating isn't just a number. Valor (discussed below) upgrades are tied to your character's Mythic+ rating. Like Conquest and other similar systems, your Mythic+ Rating will be reset at the start of a new season.</p>
					<p>In order to maximize your score, you must complete every dungeon on both <span class="hard">Fortified</span> and <span class="hard">Tyrannical</span> weeks, as they are scored separately. Whichever of the two versions yields your higher rating for each dungeon will provide full points, and the other will provide 1/3rd of the points. Check the example below for more information.</p>
				<br>
				<div class="table__note">
					<p>Example: Let's say you've achieved the following ratings in Plaguefall: Fortified - 100, Tyrannical - 90</p>
					<p>Your rating for Plaguefall would then be: (higher rating) + (1/3)*(lower rating) = (100) + (1/3)*(90) = <span class="hard">130</span></p>
				</div>
				<p>Your overall Mythic+ Rating is simply the sum of your ratings for all dungeons.</p>

			<h2 class="title">Getting Shadowlands Keystone Master: Season 3 and your seasonal mount</h2>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Keystone Master: Season 3 unlocks when you get 2500 Mythic+ score. You can achieve this score by getting 250+ score per dungeon, which roughly equates to doing every dungeon at +15 on both the Tyrannical and Fortified affix. The score requirement is 500 points higher this season because two new dungeons were added</p>
