				<p>
					I gotta rewrite all of this and I haven't read much about the new loot system. Gimme a day or two to get a more complete and (hopefully) simpler writeup done.<br>
					I do know at least these things:<br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<ul>
				<li>This system is more complicated than Valor because why not take a perfectly fine system and just strip it out instead of iterating on it logically lmao</li>
				<li>It's pretty simple though: do harder content, get better rewards</li>
				<li>you can get Flightstones from endgame activities, including world content.</li>
				<li>There is no limit to the amount of Flightstones you can GAIN a week, but you can only carry 2000 at a time.</li>
				<li>Shadowflame Crests DO have a weekly cap (150 per type)</li>
				<li>Shadowflame Crests only allow you to upgrade items to a certain item level. Shadowflame Crests and gear earned from harder end game activities have a higher upgrade floor and ceiling. [citation needed]</li>
				<li>There is an <strong>account-wide</strong> 60% Flightstone discount that is applied when you receive an item that is a higher item level than you currently have.</li>
				<li>In short, get an item to to an item level and it costs 60% less Flightstones to get other items to that item level.</li>

					I'm sure there's more but that's all I have to write right now.
