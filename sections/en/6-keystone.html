				<p>Complete a keystone run within the timer to upgrade a keystone to the next level.<span class="affixes-list__note"></br>Example: Your group completes Halls of Valor +6 in 36 minutes and 32 seconds. The par timer is 38 minutes, the keystone levels up from level 6 to level 7 and rolls a new random dungeon.</p>
				<p>Complete a keystone run with 20% of the timer remaining and upgrade the keystone 2 times in one go.</br><span class="affixes-list__note">Example: Your group completes Nokhud Offensive +5 in 30 minutes and 54 seconds. The par timer is 38 minutes, so the keystone levels up from level 5 to level 7 and rolls a new random dungeon.</span></p>
				<p>Complete a keysone run with 40% of the timer remaining and upgrade the keystone 3 times in one go.</br><span class="affixes-list__note">Example: Your group completes Halls of Valor +2 in 19 minutes and 34 seconds. The par timer is 38 minutes, so the keystone levels up from keystone level 2 to keystone level 5 and rolls a new random dungeon.</span></p>
				<p>Didn't beat the timer? That's ok. Your keystone just levels down by 1 and rerolls the dungeon.</br><span class="affixes-list__note">Example: Your group completes Ruby Life Pools +5 but misses the timer. Your keystone downgrades to Ruby Life Pools +4.</span></p>
				<p>Don't have a keystone? Completing a keystone run will net you a key at the end of the run. This keystone will be one level under the keystone run level you complete.<br>
				You can also get a key from the Great Vault based on the highest key you completed last week. If you did a 15 last week, you'll get a 15 this week from your vault. If you do not complete any keystones for a week, the level degrades by 1 and continues to degrade by one for every week you do not do a higher difficulty keystone.</br><span class="affixes-list__note">Example: you complete an Azure Vault  +7 - the chest at the end will have a random +6 key in it.<br>
				Example 2: you completed a Algeth'ar Academy +0 - the chest at the end will have a +2 keystone for a random dungeon in it.<br>
				Example 3: your highest key you complete for a week is a 15, but you do not do a key the following week. Your keystone degrades to a +14 on the third week</span></p>

			<h2 class="title">Time penalty for deaths</h2>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p>Five seconds are subtracted from the timer any time a player dies in a keystone run. While this may seem inconsequential at first, the time lost to death will add up quickly if players die to mechanics frequently. This can easily result in missing the timer.</p>

				<p>The following table shows the amount of time you have to complete a keystone run and upgrade your key. The +2 and +3 columns show how much time you have to complete a keystone run in order to +2 or +3 a key.</p>
