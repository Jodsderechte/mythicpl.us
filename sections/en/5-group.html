			<h1 class="title title--large">Group Considerations</h1>
			<div class="text-block">
				<p><strong>Group makeup barely matters at low keystone levels. There is little reason to sweat your group composition on keys below 15. Bring the player, not the class.</strong></p>
				<p>That being said, your group composition will always be one tank, one healer, and three DPS. Multi-tank strategies are not viable, no matter how much you think they should be.</p>
				<p>It's important to build a group that is well rounded in order increase your chances of completing a keystone within the timer. This means bringing consumables to make up for gaps in your group composition.</p>
				<p>When considering your group composition, it is also to consider what each class can bring to the table. Does your group have:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Ways to dispel buffs on enemies?</li>
					<li>Ways to dispel debuffs on allies?</li>
					<li>Multiple interrupts or other CC to stop enemy casting?</li>
					<li>Strong CC for difficult trash pulls?</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Again, selecting your group carefully matters mostly for higher level keys where the difficulty of the run is often very high. For lower level keystone runs, group makeup is not as important. Just saying. Do what you want. <pre><code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></pre></p>
				<h2 class="title">Consumables</h2>
				<h3 class="title">Mandatory (at least above keystone level 10)</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Current food</li>
					<li>Current flasks</li>
					<li>Current potions</li>
					<li>Repair mount/Auto-Hammer/Jeeves/Reeves</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="title">"Missing a class" consumables</h3>
				<ol>
					<li data-trn-key="group_cons_drums">Drums (any tier is fine, they all give 15% haste <sup><a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/51841-drums-haste-effects-nerfed-to-15-in-shadowlands/">[source]</a></sup>): sorta makes up for no Bloodlust/Heroism/Time Warp/Hysteria, but the nerf from 25% haste to 15% really hurts the value of drums.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="title">Optional/niche/high key consumables</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Invisibility potions (used for skipping troubling trash packs at high key levels)</li>
					<li>Augment runes</li>
				</ol>
