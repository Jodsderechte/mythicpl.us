				<h3 class="title title--small title--left trn">Addon Managers</h3>
				<h3 class="title title--small title--left trn">A brief message about addon managers</h3>
				<p>As someone who values their privacy online, I feel like it's important that I mention the Overwolf client is BAD and all of its privacy options are OPT-OUT by default, instead of OPT-IN. I encourage you to use an open source addon manager like <a href="https://wowup.io">wowup.io</a> or <a href="https://github.com/layday/instawow">instawow</a>. Just my two cents.</p>
