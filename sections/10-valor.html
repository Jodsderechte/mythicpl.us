				<p>Completing mythic dungeons, callings, and keystone runs will now award you with Valor, a currency that allows you to upgrade gear earned through mythic dungeons and keystone runs. The amount of Valor (135 per run) you get from mythic keystone runs is STATIC and does not scale with the difficulty of the keystone completed, so you can run low keys to easily get Valor. Valor does not have a traditional weekly cap, but a season cap (just like Conquest). This means that there's no <i>REAL</i> penalty if you don't cap in a week, as you can always catch up. There is no limit to the amount of Valor you can hold besides the current season cap.</p>
				<p class="hard">As of 9.1, players will receive bonus Valor when a run increases the Mythic+ Rating of any player in your group, for a grand total of 200 Valor per run.</p>
				<p>Like I mentioned above, gear acquired from the end of run chest and Great Vault can be upgraded to a maximum item level of 246.</p>
				<p>In order to upgrade past certain item level thresholds you will need to complete seasonal mythic plus achievements:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">226 item level</span>, you do not need any M+ score.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">229 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="easy">600</span> Mythic+ Rating.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">233 and 236 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="easy">1000+</span> Mythic+ Rating.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">239 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="med">1400+</span> Mythic+ Rating.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">242 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="med">1700+</span> Mythic+ Rating.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">246 item level</span>, you need to have the <span class="hard">2000+</span>Mythic+ Rating.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Unlike 9.0.5, the achievements are NOT ACCOUNT WIDE, which means you must earn score on any alts to be able to upgrade their gear. <i>This is a terrible decision by Blizzard, in my opinion.</i></p>
				<p>The cost to upgrade gear is static, meaning the cost does not change no matter the item level. Here's a table that shows how much it costs to level up a piece of gear:</p>

					<thead class="table__head">
