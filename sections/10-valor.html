				<p>Completing mythic dungeons, callings, and keystone runs will now  award you with Valor. Valor is a currency that allows you to upgrade gear earned via mythic dungeons.

				The amount of Valor you get from mythic keystone runs is STATIC. It does not scale with  the difficulty of the keystone completed. This means you can run low keys to farm Valor. 

				<span style="display: none">Valor does not have a traditional weekly cap, but a season cap (like Conquest). Thus, there's no REAL penalty if you don't cap Valor in a week as you can always catch up. There is no limit to the amount of Valor you can hold besides the current season cap. The seasonal cap has been removed for the duration of patch 9.1.5.</span>
				<br>
				If any player's mythic plus score goes up as a result of completing the run, the group is awarded an 65 extra Valor. This means a total of <span class="easy">200 Valor</span> can be earned from a successful run.</p>
				<p>Gear acquired from the end of run chest and Great Vault can be upgraded to a maximum item level of 246.</p>
				<p>Upgrading gear requires reaching mythic plus score thresholds:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">226 item level</span>, you do not need any Mythic+ score.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">229 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="easy">600</span> Mythic+ score.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">233 and 236 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="easy">1000+</span> Mythic+ score.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">239 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="med">1400+</span> Mythic+ score.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">242 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="med">1700+</span> Mythic+ score.</li>
					<li>To upgrade an item to <span class="hard">246 item level</span>, you need to have <span class="hard">2000+</span> Mythic+ score.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Rating is <strong>NOT ACCOUNT WIDE</strong>, which means you must earn score on alts to be able to upgrade their gear. <i>This is a terrible decision by Blizzard, in my opinion.</i></p>
				<p>The cost to upgrade gear is static, meaning the cost does not change no matter the item level. Here's a table that shows how much it costs to level up a piece of gear:</p>
