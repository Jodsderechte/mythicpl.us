				<p><strong class="trn">Group makeup barely matters at low keystone levels. There is little reason to sweat your group composition on keys below 15. Bring the player, not the class.</strong></p>
				<p class="trn">That being said, your group composition will always be one tank, one healer, and three DPS. Multi-tank strategies are not viable, no matter how much you think they should be.</p>

					<li class="trn">Ways to dispel buffs on enemies?</li>
					<li class="trn">Ways to dispel debuffs on allies?</li>
					<li class="trn">Multiple interrupts or other CC to stop enemy casting?</li>
					<li class="trn">Strong CC for difficult trash pulls?</li>
				</ol>
